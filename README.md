**Currently Available:**
**CAM**
  ~ CAM is the very first project I coded myself. Mostly a click-through menu,
  CAM is a Cat Adoption Manager that sprung off of a simple sales calculator and is
  studded with ASCII art - mostly of cats. Users can click through three cats, read their descriptions,
  and eventually select their cat for purchase!
**QuizMe**
  ~ QuizMe is the start of a quiz make-and-take app where users could add quizzes and questions,
  take the quizzes, and make quizzes from questions already in the database. Currently, the bones of the 
  database and backend frameworks are in place!
